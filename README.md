# Big Input Box
A really big input box. Because why not.

### How to Use
You just hit `Enter` and type something. If you wish to move it, hold down a modifier like `Shift`, and drag it by its label/title area. To reset the position, hold down `Shift`, and click its label, but not drag. Tadaa!

### How to change character language
Just hover the cursor above the box, and click the language text appearing right below it to toggle your character's spoken language. When a non-default language is chosen, the language text will remain visible as long as the editbox is visible, reminding you of what language you are typing in.

### Why doesn't the keybind for opening the chat slash work?
Blizzard limitation. That would require our addon to be responsible for having put the `/` character into the editbox, which in turn would be considered a change to the secure editbox execution path and finally result in you NOT being able to cast spells or perform secure actions through chat. 

This is a part of Blizzard's anti-bot systems, as the ability for addons to do this would ultimately allows us to create bots that could cast spells through addons.
